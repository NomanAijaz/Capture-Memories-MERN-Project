# Capture-Memories-MERN-Project

This is the fully functional web application to store memories pictures along with title and descrpition. it is a platform where you can sign up and showcase your memories, events and many more other people can also see your posts and react on them. I have used MERN stack technology to complete this project. I have used Formik and Yup library of Reactjs to validate the form and Redux for statement. Besides, I have used Json-web-token (jwt) for user Authentication.
